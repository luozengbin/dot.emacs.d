数字を使用する限りはそのまま動作する。

GNU Emacsが扱う（7ビットの）ASCIIコードの文字は、コンピュータ内部では1
文字を1バイトで表現し、これらの文字は画面上の表示でも1文字あたり1コラム
を占める。したがって、文字数、内部表現のバイト数、表示コラム数のどれを
とっても同じ値である。また、テキストをファイルに収めたときの文字コード
とGNU Emacsのバッファ内での文字コードはまったく同じである。

ところが、多国語を扱うMuleでは、こうはならない。各国ごとにその国の文字
を1バイトあるいは2バイトで表す規格がある。たとえば、日本には文字コード
の規格としてJIS X 0208があり2バイトで1文字を表す。また、ローマ字とカタ
カナの規格としてJIS X 0201があり1バイトで1文字を表す。

1つのバッファ内に複数の国の文字コードが混在してもよいように、Muleでは1
バイトないしは2バイトの文字コードのまえに識別用に1バイト（ないしは2バイ
ト）を付加してバッファ内に保持する。この識別用のバイトを*リーディングキャ
ラクタ（leading character）*と呼ぶ。ただし、7ビットのASCIIコードの文字
は、GNU Emacsと同じで、リーディングキャラクタは付加しない。

たとえば、日本語の「あ」は、文字数は1であるが、
内部表現には3バイト必要であり、表示には2コラム必要である。
半角の「ア」は、文字数は1であるが、内部表現には2バイト必要であり、
表示には1コラム必要である。
ASCII文字の「a」は、文字数も内部表現のバイト数も表示コラム数も1である。

このため、Muleでは、関数 `length' （*Note length::）は、文字列の「文字
数」ではなく、内部表現の「バイト数」を返す。バッファ内のポイントやマー
ク（*Note Buffer Size & Locations::）の位置も、「文字数」ではなく内部表
現の「バイト数」が単位である。

一方、関数`forward-char'は、その名前から予想されるように、文字単位でポ
イントを移動する。文字列の「文字数」を調べるには関数`chars-in-string'を
使い、「表示コラム数」を調べるには関数`string-width'を使う。

     (length          "abcあいう")     => 12
     (chars-in-string "abcあいう")     =>  6
     (string-width    "abcあいう")     =>  9

`.emacs'（*Note Emacs Initialization::）でMuleの版を区別するには、関数
`mule-version'が返す文字列を使う。また、日本語入力に「Wnn」、「sj3」、
「かんな」のどれが使えるかを判別し、それぞれに固有の設定を行うには、関
数`featurep'を使ってつぎのようにする。

     (if (and (not (featurep 'egg)) (featurep 'canna))
         (progn 「かんな」に固有の設定 ... ))

     (if (and (featurep 'egg) (featurep 'wnn-egg))
         (progn 「WNN」に固有の設定 ... ))

     (if (and (featurep 'egg) (featurep 'sj3-egg))
         (progn 「SJ3」に固有の設定 ... ))

MuleがX Window Systemのクライアントとして動作している場合、変数
`window-system'には値`x'が、そうでない場合には`nil'が束縛されるので、つ

対象とする読者
==============

本書は、プログラマではない人向けの初歩の入門書である。すでにプログラマ
である読者には、本書は物足りないであろう。というのは、そのような読者は
すでにリファレンスマニュアルを存分に読めるようになっており、本書の構成
は間延びして見えるであろう。

経験あるプログラマは、本書をつぎのように評価してくれた。

     リファレンスマニュアルで学ぶほうが好きである。各段落に「飛び込ん
     で」、段落のあいだで「息つぎ」する。

     段落を読み終えたときには、そこで取り上げた話題は完結しており、必要

     たと仮定したい。よく構成されたリファレンスマニュアルには、冗長な部

本書は、このような人向けではない！

第一に、おのおののことがらを少なくとも3回は説明するように努めた。1回目
は紹介、2回目は使い方、3回目は別の使い方や復習である。

第二に、1つの話題に関するすべての情報を1か所にまとめることはせずに、1つ
の段落に詰め過ぎないようにした。  筆者の考え方では、そうしないと読者に
重荷を背負わせることになるからである。かわりに、その時点で必要なことの
みを説明するように努めた（あとで詳しく説明する場合に備えて、少々余分に
説明する場面もある）。

1回読むだけで、すべてを理解してもらえるとは考えていない。読者は、説明内
容を「わかったつもり」にしておく必要があるだろう。重要なことがらを正し
く読者に指し示し、注意を促すように本書を構成したつもりである。

いくつかの段落には、「飛び込んで」もらうしかなく、それ以外に読み進む方
法はない。しかし、そのような段落の個数は少なくするように努めた。本書は
登頂困難な山ではなく、楽に歩ける小山である。

本書`Emacs Lispプログラミング'入門には、姉妹編と呼ぶべきドキュメント

リファレンスマニュアルには本書より詳しい説明がある。
リファレンスマニュアルでは、1つの話題に関する情報は1か所にすべてまとめてある。

Lispのアトム *(2004/01/16)*
---------------------------

Lispでは、これまで単語と呼んできたものを"アトム（atoms）"と呼ぶ。この用
語はアトム（原子）の歴史的な意味からきており、「不可分」ということであ
る。Lispに関していえば、リストに用いてきた単語はそれ以上には小さく分割
できず、プログラムの一部として同じものを意味する。数や`+'のような1文字
の記号についてもそうである。一方、アトムとは異なり、リストは部分に分割
できる（*Note car cdr & cons::）。

リストでは、アトムを空白で区切る。アトムは、括弧のすぐ隣にあってもよい。

技術的には、Lispのリストは、空白で区切ったアトムを囲む括弧、リストを囲
む括弧、アトムやリストを囲む括弧から成る。リストは、たった1個のアトムを
含むだけでも、まったく含まなくてもよい。何も含まないリストは`()'のよう
に書き、"空リスト（empty list）"と呼ぶ。空リストは、それ以外のものとは
異なり、アトムであると同時にリストでもある。

アトムやリストを表示したものを"シンボリック式（symbolic expressions）"、
あるいは、より簡素には"S式（s-expressions）"と呼ぶ。用語「"式
（expression）"」そのものでは、表示したアトムやリスト、あるいは、コン
ピュータ内部に格納したアトムやリストを意味する。しばしば、これらを区別
せずに用語「"式（expression）"」を使う（さらに、多くの書籍では式の同義
語として用語「"フォーム（form）"」を使う）。

われわれの宇宙を構成するアトム（原子）は、それらが不可分であると考えら

配列などのある種のアトムは構成部分に分割できるが、この分割機構はリスト
を分割する機構とは異なる。リスト操作に関する限り、リストのアトムは分割
できない。

英語の場合と同様に、Lispのアトムを構成する文字は、単語を作り上げる個々
の文字とは異なる。たとえば、南米のナマケモノを表す単語`ai'（ミツユビナ
マケモノ）は、2つの単語`a'と`i'とはまったく異なる。

自然界には多種類の原子が存在するが、Lispには数種類のアトムしかない。た

などの"シンボル（symbols）"である。これまで例にあげた単語はすべてシンボ

のは、プログラマは扱っているアトムの種類を特定しようとするからである。

リスト内の空白 *(2004/01/16)*
-----------------------------

リスト内の空白の個数はいくつでもよい。Lisp言語の視点からすれば、

     '(this list
        looks like this)

は、つぎとまったく同等である。

     '(this list looks like this)

どちらの例もLispにとっては同じリストであり、
`this'、`list'、`looks'、`like'、
`this'のシンボルからこの順に構成されたリストである。

余分な空白や改行は人間がリストを見やすくするためのものである。Lispが式

GNU Emacsのリスト入力補佐機能 *(2004/03/28)*
--------------------------------------------

GNU EmacsのLisp InteractionモードやEmacs LispモードでLispの式を入力する
時には、Lispの式を読みやすく整形するためのコマンドを利用できる。たとえ
ば、TABキーを押すと、カーソルを置いた行を自動的に字下げする。あるリージョ

いる。リストの各要素が、どのリストに属するかがわかりやすくなるように字
下げする。つまり、内側のリストの各要素は、そのリストを囲むリストの要素
よりも字下げされる。

さらに、閉じ括弧をタイプするとEmacsは対応する開き括弧に一時的にカーソル
を移動して、対応関係がわかるようにする。Lispに与える個々のリストは括弧
の対応が取れている必要があるので、これはとても便利である(*Note Major

===============================

Lispのどんなリストも実行できるプログラムである。それを実行する（Lispの

の1つを行う。リストそのものを返して、それ以外のことは何もしない。エラー

えにあげたリスト`(+ 2 2)'の直前にはクオートがないので、Lispは、`+'がリ

GNU EmacsのInfoで読んでいる場合には、つぎのようにしてリストを評価する。
つぎのリストの閉じ括弧の直後にカーソルを置いてから
`C-x C-e'とタイプする。

     (+ 2 2)

その一方で、シンボルには1つの関数定義しか結び付けられない。さもなければ、

評　価 *(2004/01/17)*
=====================

Lispインタープリタが式を処理することを"評価する（evaluation）"と呼ぶ。
インタープリタが「式を評価する」という。これまでにも、この用語を何度か
使ってきた。この用語は日常の言葉使いからきている。つまり、`Webster's
New Collegiate Dictionary'によれば、「価値や量を見定める、見積もること」
である。

式を評価し終えると、Lispインタープリタは、関数定義で与えられた命令列を

このような評価の過程を、加算の例題で調べることにしよう。つぎの式の直後

であり、これは値6を返す。続いて、外側の式を`(+ 2 6)'であるかのように評
価し、これは値8を返す。評価すべき外側の式はもうないので、インタープリタ
はこの値をエコー領域に表示する。

さて、キー列`C-x C-e'で起動されるコマンドの名前を理解するのは容易である。
コマンドの名前は`eval-last-sexp'である。`sexp'は「シンボリック式
（symbolic expression）」の略、`eval'は「評価（evaluate）」の略である。
コマンドの意味は、「直前のシンボリック式を評価する」である。

式の直後の行の先頭や式の内側にカーソルを置いても式を評価できるかどうか
試してみよう。

つぎの式で試してみる。

引数のデータ型 *(2004/01/16)*
-----------------------------

関数に渡すデータの型は、関数が使用する情報の種類に応じて決まる。`+'は数
を加算するので、`+'のような関数への引数は数値である必要がある。別の関数
では別の種類のデータの引数が必要である。

たとえば、関数`concat'は複数の文字列を繋いで1つの文字列を生成する。した
がって、引数は文字列である。文字列`abc'と`def'を繋ぐ（concatinate）と、
1つの文字列`abcdef'が作られる。これはつぎの式を評価するとわかる。

     (concat "abc" "def")

この式を評価して得られる値は`"abcdef"'である。

`substring'のような関数は、引数として文字列と数を取る。この関数は文字列
の一部分、つまり、第1引数の部分文字列を返す。この関数は3つの引数を取る。
第1引数は文字列であり、第2引数と第3引数は数で、部分文字列の開始位置と終
了位置を示す。これらの数は、文字列の先頭からの（空白や句読点を含む）文
字の個数である。

たとえば、つぎを評価すると、

     (substring "The quick brown fox jumped." 16 19)

エコー領域には`"fox"'と表示される。引数は、1つの文字列と2つの数である。

`substring'に渡された文字列は、空白で区切られた複数の単語ではあるが1つ

`fill-column'そのものを評価すると数を返す。この数は加算に使える。

つぎの式のうしろにカーソルを置いて`C-x C-e'とタイプする。

     (+ 2 fill-column)

`fill-column'を単独で評価した値より2だけ大きな値が得られる。筆者の場合
には、`fill-column'の値は72なので、結果は74である。

このように、評価すると値を返すシンボルを引数に使えるのである。
さらに、評価すると値を返すリストを引数に使うこともできる。
たとえば、つぎの式では、関数`concat'への引数は、
文字列`"The "'と`" red foxes."'、
さらに、リスト`(number-to-string (+ 2 fill-column))'である。

     (concat "The " (number-to-string (+ 2 fill-column)) " red foxes.")

この式を評価すると、(もし私のEmacsのように `fill-column' が 72 になっていれ
ば) エコー領域には`"The 74 red foxes."'と表示される
（最終結果の文字列に空白が含まれるように、
単語`The'の直後と単語`red'の直前には空白が必要である．関数
`number-to-string' は加算関数が返す整数を文字に変換する．
`number-to-string' は `int-to-string' でも同じである）。

`hello'であり、数ではない。加算できるのは数のみである。したがって、`+'

       eval-last-sexp(nil)
       call-interactively(eval-last-sexp)

普通、エラーメッセージは有用なようになっているので、読み方がわかれば意
味がわかる。

エラーメッセージの最初の部分は簡単で、
`Wrong type argument'、つまり、引数の型がまちがっているである。
つぎは、不思議な専門用語で`number-or-marker-p'である。
これは、`+'が仮定する引数の種類を伝えようとしているのである。

シンボル`number-or-marker-p'の意味は、Lispインタープリタが渡された情報
（引数の値）が整数（数）かマーカー（バッファ内の位置を表す特殊なオブジェ
クト）かどうかを調べようとしているということである。つまり、加算すべき
整数が`+'に与えられたかどうかを検査したのである。このとき、引数が、
Emacs Lispに特有の機能であるマーカーかどうかも検査する（Emacsでは、バッ

すると、その位置はマーカーとして保存される。マークは数として扱うことが
でき、バッファの先頭からのその位置までの文字の個数である）。Emacs Lisp
では、`+'でマーカー位置の数値を数として加算できる。

`number-or-marker-p'の`p'は、Lispプログラミングの早い時期に始まった慣習
である。`p'は「述語（predicate）」の略である。初期のLisp研究者が用いた

そのほかのLispシンボルには、引数の値が0であるかを調べる関数`zerop'、引
数がリストであるかを調べる関数`listp'がある。


エラーメッセージの最後の部分はシンボル`hello'である。これは`+'に渡され

たならば、エラーメッセージが表示されることはなかったのである。
